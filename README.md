A library for validating emails against several RFC.

## Supported RFCs

This library aims to support RFCs:

* [5321](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321), 
* [5322](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322), 
* [6530](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6530), 
* [6531](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6531), 
* [6532](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6532),
* [1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035) 

## Supported versions

**Current major version with full support is v3**

| Version |  Released  | EOL | Only critical bug fixes | Full |

## Requirements

 * PHP 8.1
 * [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) is required for installation
 * [Spoofchecking](/src/Validation/Extra/SpoofCheckValidation.php) and [DNSCheckValidation](/src/Validation/DNSCheckValidation.php) validation requires that your PHP system has the [PHP Internationalization Libraries](https://php.net/manual/en/book.intl.php) (also known as PHP Intl)

**Note**: `PHP version upgrades will happen to accomodate to the pace of major frameworks. Minor versions bumps will go via minor versions of this library (i.e: PHP7.3 -> v3.x+1). Major versions will go with major versions of the library`

## Installation

Run the command below to install via Composer

```shell
composer require egulias/email-validator
```

## Getting Started

`EmailValidator` requires you to decide which (or combination of them) validation/s strategy/ies you'd like to follow for each [validation](#available-validations).

A basic example with the RFC validation
```php
<?php

use Egulias\EmailValidator\EmailValidator;
use Egulias\EmailValidator\Validation\RFCValidation;

$validator = new EmailValidator();
$validator->isValid("example@example.com", new RFCValidation()); //true
```


### Available validations

1. [RFCValidation](/src/Validation/RFCValidation.php): Standard RFC-like email validation.
2. [NoRFCWarningsValidation](/src/Validation/NoRFCWarningsValidation.php): RFC-like validation that will fail when warnings* are found.
3. [DNSCheckValidation](/src/Validation/DNSCheckValidation.php): Will check if there are DNS records that signal that the server accepts emails. This does not entail that the email exists.
4. [MultipleValidationWithAnd](/src/Validation/MultipleValidationWithAnd.php): It is a validation that operates over other validations performing a logical and (&&) over the result of each validation.
5. [MessageIDValidation](/src/Validation/MessageIDValidation.php): Follows [RFC2822 for message-id](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#section-3.6.4) to validate that field, that has some differences in the domain part.
6. [Your own validation](#how-to-extend): You can extend the library behaviour by implementing your own validations.

*warnings: Warnings are deviations from the RFC that in a broader interpretation are accepted.

```php
<?php

use Egulias\EmailValidator\EmailValidator;
use Egulias\EmailValidator\Validation\DNSCheckValidation;
use Egulias\EmailValidator\Validation\MultipleValidationWithAnd;
use Egulias\EmailValidator\Validation\RFCValidation;

$validator = new EmailValidator();
$multipleValidations = new MultipleValidationWithAnd([
    new RFCValidation(),
    new DNSCheckValidation()
]);
//ietf.org has MX records signaling a server with email capabilities
$validator->isValid("example@ietf.org", $multipleValidations); //true
```

#### Additional validations
Validations not present in the RFCs 

1. [SpoofCheckValidation](/src/Validation/Extra/SpoofCheckValidation.php): Will check for multi-utf-8 chars that can signal an erroneous email name.


### How to extend

It's easy! You just need to implement [EmailValidation](/src/Validation/EmailValidation.php) and you can use your own validation.
